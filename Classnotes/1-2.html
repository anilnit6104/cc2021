			<h3> Introduction Cloud Computing </h3>
			
					Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
					<br><br> Cloud computing means that instead of all the computer hardware and software you're using sitting on your desktop, or somewhere inside your company's network, it's provided for you as a service by another company and accessed over the Internet, usually in a completely seamless way.
					<br><br>Exactly where the hardware and software is located and how it all works doesn't matter to you, the user—it's just somewhere up in the "cloud" that the Internet represents.
					<br><br>You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

				<h3> Simple examples of cloud computing </h3>
                    

						You all are probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don’t realise it. If you use an online service to send email, edit documents, watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games or store pictures and other files, it is likely that cloud computing is making it all possible behind the scenes. 
						<br>The first cloud computing services are barely a decade old, but already a variety of organizations—from tiny startups to global corporations, government agencies to non-profits—are embracing the technology for all sorts of reasons.
						Soundcloud, Google's, Web-based email, Google Documents, Google collab, etc.

                <br><h3>Top benefits of cloud computing </h3>
				
						Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. Here are seven common reasons organisations are turning to cloud computing services:
						<br><br><b> 1. Cost: </b> 
						Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters —the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.
						
						<br><br><b> 2. Speed: </b>
						Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.
						
						<br><br><b> 3. Global scale: </b>
						The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when it is needed and from the right geographic location.
						Cloud Computing provides businesses with the ability to regulate the service in accordance with their current requirements:
						<li>Scale capacity up and down as needed</li>
						<li>Infinite computing capacity on demand</li>
						<li>Flexibility through cloud bursting</li>
						
						<br><br><b> 4. Productivity: </b>
						On-site data centers typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.
						
						<br><br><b> 5. Performance: </b>
						The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.
						
						<br><br><b> 6. Reliability: </b>
						Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.
						Security. Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps and infrastructure from potential threats.

						<br><br><h3>Characteristics of Cloud Computing</h3>

						<li><b>On-demand self-service:</b> Cloud resources can be accessed or provisioned without human interaction. With this model, consumers can gain immediate access to cloud services upon signup. </li>

						<li><b>Broad network access: </b> Users can access cloud services and resources through any device and in any networked location provided that they have permission.</li>

						<li><b>Resource pooling: </b> Cloud provider resources are shared by multiple tenants while keeping the data of individual clients hidden from other clients.</li>

						<li><b>Rapid elasticity: </b> Unlike on-premise hardware and software, cloud computing resources can be rapidly increased, decreased, or otherwise modified based on the cloud user’s changing needs.</li>

						<li><b>Measured service: </b> Usage of cloud resources is metered so that businesses and other cloud users need only pay for the resources they use in any given billing cycle. </li>

                     <br><h3>Components of Cloud Computing</h3>
								<li><b>Client Infrastructure : </b> The client infrastructure component is the part of the frontend which provides a graphic user interface (GUI) for the user to interact with the cloud. </li> 

								<li><b>Application : </b> An application is any platform like an app or software offered by a company by which the clients access the cloud. </li>

								<li><b> Service : </b> A cloud service manages the kind of service that a client needs to use according to his requirement. There are three types of services in cloud computing. </li>
