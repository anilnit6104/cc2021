			<h2>Data Center</h2>
			<li>A data center is a facility of one or more buildings that house a centralized computing infrastructure, typically servers, storage, and networking equipment.</li>
			<li>A data center's design is based on a network of computing and storage resources that enable the delivery of shared applications and data.</li>
			<li>The key components of a data center design include routers, switches, firewalls, storage systems, servers, and application delivery controllers.</li>

			<br><br><h3>What Does a Data Center Do?</h3>
			<br>A data center is designed to handle high volumes of data and traffic with minimum latency, which makes it particularly useful for the following use cases:

			<li>Private cloud: hosting in-house business productivity applications such as Customer relationship management (CRM), ERP, etc.</li>
			<li>Processing big data, powering machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</li>
			<li>High-volume eCommerce transactions.</li>
			<li>Powering online gaming platforms and communities.</li>
			<li>Data storage, backup, recovery, and management.</li>

			<br><h3>What is in a data center facility?</h3>
					Datacenter components require significant infrastructure to support the center's hardware and software.
					These include
			<li>power subsystems</li>
			<li>uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)</li>
			<li>ventilation, cooling systems</li>
			<li>fire suppression</li>
			<li>backup generators</li>
			<li>connections to external networks</li>
			<br><h3>Types of data centers</h3>
					Many types of data centers and service models are available. Their classification depends on whether they are owned by one or many organizations, how they fit (if they fit) into the topology of other data centers, what technologies they use for computing and storage, and even their energy efficiency.

			<br><br><b>There are four main types of data centers:</b>

			<br><b>1. Enterprise data centers</b>
					These are built, owned, and operated by companies and are optimized for their end-users. Most often they are housed on the corporate campus.

			<br><b>2. Managed services data centers</b>
					These data centers are managed by a third party (or a managed services provider) on behalf of a company. The company leases the equipment and infrastructure instead of buying it.

			<br><b>3. Colocation data centers</b>
					In colocation ("colo") data centers, a company rents space within a data center owned by others and located off company premises. The colocation data center hosts the infrastructure: building, cooling, bandwidth, security, etc., while the company provides and manages the components, including servers, storage, and firewalls.

			<br><b>4. Cloud data centers</b>
					In this off-premises form of the data center, data and applications are hosted by a cloud services provider such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), or IBM Cloud or another public cloud provider.

			<br><br><b>Choosing the Data Center Location Is Crucial:</b>

			<li>Proximity to major markets and customers — Latency and reliable connections play a major factor in running an efficient facility that meets customer demand.
			<li>Labor costs and availability — While labor costs may be good in a particular region, is there enough talent (across disciplines) needed to run and maintain your data center?
			<li>Environmental conditions — Temperature and humidity variances wreak havoc on environmental systems and forecasting. Earthquakes, hurricanes, blizzards, and tornadoes are unpredictable and can shut down a facility indefinitely. Keep this in mind.</li>
			<li>Airport and highway accessibility and quality — You need large equipment and service equipment to build and maintain the data center. It must also be readily accessible for delivery, services, and employees.</li>
			<li>Availability and cost of real estate options — Build versus buy requires considering building costs and quality of construction, versus incentives from landlords and local governments.</li>
			<li>Amount of local and state economic development incentives — Beyond construction considerations, local jurisdiction may provide development incentives in rural or redevelopment areas, and less inviting in densely populated or over-resourced areas. On the counter side of this are the taxes and regulatory requirements that can be costly and restrictive.</li>
			<li>Availability of telecommunications infrastructure — Make sure local providers can meet your future bandwidth demands and that there are not only redundant systems from your provider but that you have multiple providers available.</li>
			<li>Cost of utilities — Costs vary globally and in some geographies, you may not have an option of where you place your data center and considering alternative power sources is prudent and in some countries, required.</li>

			<br><h3>What Does Data Center Design Mean?</h3>
			<li>Datacenter design is the process of modeling and designing a data center's IT resources, architectural layout, and entire infrastructure.</li>
			<li>It enables the logical conception of a data center prior to development or implementation in an organization or IT environment.</li>
			<li>Although data center is a broad term that includes various processes and techniques, a data center design may be in the form of documents, modeled diagram systems, or a combination of both.</li>
					
			<br>The computing aspect of data center design may incorporate any of the following:

			<li>Number and type of required servers</li>
			<li>Network layout and equipment</li>
			<li>Enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), data center management, or any other required software.</li>

			<br>The non-computing aspect includes but is not limited to the following:

			<li>A physical facility that houses all equipment</li>
			<li>Datacenter power, cooling, and ventilation systems</li>
			<li>Physical data center security, disaster recovery, and business continuity planning.</li>

			<br><br><h2>Data Center Interconnect (DCI)</h2>
			<b>Data Center Interconnect (DCI) technology connects two or more data centers together over short, medium, or long distances using high-speed packet-optical connectivity.</b>

			<br>Point to point connectivity
			<br>Datacenter interconnect is used for:
			<li>To connect multiple data centers within the same organization.</li>
			<li>To connect partner/customer data centers with shared data and/or resources.</li>
			<li>To allow for workload sharing, wherein some of the bulk of the processes are performed at the interconnected data center.</li>
			<li>To pool data center resources to meet scalability needs.</li>
			<li>To use an interconnected data center as a disaster recovery site.</li>

			<br>Intra-Connections-The Intra Data Center interconnect refers to all the connections within the Data Center. They can be within one building, or between Data-Center buildings within the campus. The connections may be at a distance of meters to few kilometers.

			<br>Inter-Connections-These refer to the in-between connection of different datacenters.

			<br><br><h2>Storage as a Service</h2>

					Storage as a service ( STaaS) is a cloud business model in which a company leases or rents its storage infrastructure to another company or individuals to store data.

			<br><br><b>Cloud Storage :</b>
					Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider that manages and operates data storage as a service. It's delivered on-demand with just-in-time capacity and costs and eliminates buying and managing your own data storage infrastructure.

			<br>There are three types of cloud data:

			<br><b>File Storage</b> - Some applications need to access shared files and require a file system. This type of storage is often supported with a Network Attached Storage (NAS) server. File storage solutions like Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) are ideal for use cases like large content repositories, development environments, media stores, or user home directories.
			<li>This is most like the file storage system that you would find on a PC or in cloud storage apps like Microsoft OneDrive. Because it is designed for humans to navigate, file storage is ideal anytime you need to collaborate on a project with other people or businesses.</li>
			<li>Highly scalable</li>
			<li>Accessible to multiple runtimes</li>
			<li>Simultaneously read and write from multiple users.</li>

			<br><b>Block Storage -</b> Other enterprise applications like databases or ERP systems often require dedicated, low latency storage for each host. This is analogous to direct-attached storage (DAS) or a Storage Area Network (SAN). Block-based cloud storage solutions like Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) are provisioned with each virtual server and offer the ultra-low latency required for high-performance workloads.</li>
			<li>It is suitable for transactional databases, random read/write loads, and structured database storage.</li>
			<li>It divides the data to be stored in evenly sized blocks  ( eg a file can be split into evenly sized blocks before it is stored) ( Use indexing for easy retrieval)</li>
			<li>Stored data will not contain metadata  [info about data].</li>
			<li>Accessed using instance</li>
			<li>Provide the lowest possible latency</li>
			<li>It is accessed by servers using SAN</li>
