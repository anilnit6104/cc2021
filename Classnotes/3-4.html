			<li><b>Software as a Service (SaaS): </b> SaaS-based services are known as cloud application services. They run directly through a web browser eliminating the need for any download or installation of the applications—for example,  Google apps. </li>

			<li><b>Platform as a Service (PaaS): </b> PaaS services are similar to SaaS. However, PaaS services provide a platform for users to build, edit, and launch the software.

			<br> When the vendor provides Platform Layer along with Infrastructure Layer it is PaaS. It serves as a platform for the development or deployment of your code to create a cloud-based applications.

			<br> Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.

					Some relatable examples can be:

					<li>Google Colab, platforms for the data science or let’s just say Python enthusiasts.</li>

					<li>Google App Engine is a well known PaaS for building web applications and mobile backend using the preconfigured available runtimes, each of which has a set of libraries included as well.</li></li>


			<li><b>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): </b>

					It is the most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.

					It provides virtual services that eliminate the need for physical computing resources such as RAM, CPU, and data centres.

					IaaS provides servers in the cloud (virtual machine) that can be completely controlled by the users. Users would have a broad range of permissions in the server from managing the OS to their applications.

					This service gives a glimpse of typical on premises virtual machine, which allows us to login remotely and manage it.
					In IaaS, the companies run virtual servers, networks, and storage on the cloud on a paid basis. For example,
					Google Compute Engine (GCE),
					Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud,
					Amazon Web Services (AWS).</li>

					<p><br>Bottom of the diagram is the Physical Layer that comprises the Networking, Storage, and Servers i.e. all the hardware that can be physically controlled.
					Next Layer is the Infrastructure Layer that contains the virtualized servers, dockers, containers etc.

					<br>Then comes the Platform Layer that includes Operating System (OS), Middleware, Runtime, and Data.
					Finally the Application Layer helps the end-user interaction with the whole stack directly.

			<br><br><h3>Uses of cloud computing</h3>

			<li><b>Create cloud-native application : </b>Quickly build, deploy and scale applications—web, mobile and API. Take advantage of cloud-native technologies and approaches, such as containers, Kubernetes, microservices architecture, API-driven communication and DevOps.</li>


			<li><b> Test and build applications : </b>
					Reduce application development cost and time by using cloud infrastructures that can easily be scaled up or down. </li>


			<li><b> Store, back up and recover data : </b>
					Protect your data more cost-efficiently—and at massive scale—by transferring your data over the Internet to an offsite cloud storage system that is accessible from any location and any device. </li>


			<li><b>Analyse data : </b>
					Unify your data across teams, divisions and locations in the cloud. Then use cloud services, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to uncover insights for more informed decisions. </li>


			<li><b>Stream audio and video : </b>
					Connect with your audience anywhere, anytime, on any device with high-definition video and audio with global distribution. </li>

			<li><b>Deliver software on demand : </b>
					Also known as software as a service (SaaS), on-demand software lets you offer the latest software versions and updates around to customers—anytime they need, anywhere they are. </li>

			<br> To put in simple words: Cloud computing is nothing but moving on-premises computing to the internet. It saves both time and money. 

			<br> Despite all the development and potential of cloud computing services, there are multiple challenges of cloud computing services that businesses face.

			<br><br><h3>Challenges in cloud computing</h3>

			<li><b>Security: </b>
					It is because your data gets stored and processed by a third-party vendor and you cannot see it. Every day or the other, you get informed about broken authentication, compromised credentials, account hacking, data breaches, etc. in a particular organization. It makes you a little more skeptical. </li>


			<li><b>Password Security: </b>
					As large numbers of people access your cloud account, it becomes vulnerable.

					Anybody who knows your password or hacks into your cloud will be able to access your confidential information. 

					Here the organization should use a multiple level authentication and ensure that the passwords remain protected.

					Also, the passwords should be modified regularly, especially when a particular employee resigns and leave the organization.

					Access rights to usernames and passwords should be given judiciously. </li> 

			<li><b>Cost Management : </b>
					 Tuning the organization’s needs on the third-party platform.</li>

			<li><b>Lack of expertise.</b></li>
			<li><b>Internet Connectivity.</b></li>
			<li><b>Control or Governance.</b></li>
			<li><b>Compliance.</b></li>
			<li><b>Multiple Cloud Management.</b></li>
			<li><b>Creating a private cloud</b></li>
			<li><b>Performance</b></li>
			<li><b>Migration</b></li>
			
			<br><br><h3>Risks in cloud computing</h3>

			The main security risks of cloud computing are:

			<li>Compliance violations</li>
			<li>Identity theft</li>
			<li>Malware infections and data breaches</li>
			<li>Diminished customer trust and potential revenue loss</li>

			<br><h3>Approaches of Migration into Cloud</h3>

			<em>What are the types of cloud migration strategies?</em>
			<br>Broadly known as the "six R's of migration," these are the six most common approaches:
                    <br>1. Rehosting ("lift and shift")
					<br>2. Re-platforming. (Architecture is same but replacing few services) eg Weblogic to Apache tmcat
					<br>3. Repurchasing
					<br>4. Refactoring
					<br>5. Retiring
					<br>6. Retaining
