			<h4> Architecture of Cloud Computing </h4>
            <br><img src="images/7.jpg">
			
			<br><h3>Components of Cloud Computing Architecture</h3>
			<br>There are the following components of cloud computing architecture -
			<br><b>1. Client Infrastructure</b>
			Client Infrastructure is a Front end component. It provides GUI (Graphical User Interface)  to interact with the cloud.
			<br><b>2. Application</b>
			The application may be any software or platform that a client wants to access.
			<br><b>3. Service</b>
			A Cloud Services manages that which type of service you access according to the clientâ€™s requirement.
			Cloud computing offers the following three types of services:
			<br><b>i. Software as a Service (SaaS)
			<br>ii. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
			<br>iii. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</b>
			<br><b>4. Runtime Cloud</b>
			Runtime Cloud provides the execution and runtime environment to the virtual machines.
			<br><b>5. Storage</b>
			Storage is one of the most important components of cloud computing. It provides a huge amount of storage capacity in the cloud to store and manage data.
			<br><b>6. Infrastructure</b>
			It provides services on the host level, application level, and network level. Cloud infrastructure includes hardware and software components such as servers, storage, network devices, virtualization software, and other storage resources that are needed to support the cloud computing model.
			<br><b>7. Management</b>
			Management is used to manage components such as application, service, runtime cloud, storage, infrastructure, and other security issues in the backend and establish coordination between them.
			<br><b>8. Security</b>
			Security is an in-built back-end component of cloud computing. It implements a security mechanism in the back end.
			<br><b>9. Internet</b>
			The Internet is a medium through which the front end and back end can interact and communicate with each other.

			<br><br><h3>Benefits of Cloud Computing Architecture :</h3>

			<li>Makes the overall cloud computing system simpler.</li>
			<li>Improves data processing requirements.</li>
			<li>Helps in providing high security.</li>
			<li>Makes it more modularized.</li>
			<li>Results better disaster recovery.</li>
			<li>Gives good user accessibility.</li>
			<li>Reduces IT operating costs.</li>

			<br><h3>Deployment model</h3>
			<br>Since cloud technology provides many benefits to users, these benefits should be classified based on the needs of the users. The cloud deployment model represents the exact category of cloud environment based on proprietorship, size, and access and also describes the nature and purpose of the cloud. Most organizations implement cloud infrastructure to minimize capital expenditure & regulate operating costs.



			<br><br><b>Public Cloud</b>
			<br>The public cloud is defined as the IT services offered by external providers on the public Internet, which makes them available to anyone who wishes to use or buy them. Public clouds can also be implemented faster than local infrastructure and with an almost infinitely scalable platform.
