			<b>Object Storage - </b> Applications developed in the cloud often take advantage of object storage's vast scalability and metadata characteristics. Object storage solutions like Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) are ideal for building modern applications from scratch that require scale and flexibility, and can also be used to import existing data stores for analytics, backup, or archive.
			<li>It stores the whole data and does not divide.</li>
			<li>An object is the file/data itself (include metadata).</li>
			<li>Contain global unique ID (name of the file or any unique name).</li>
			<li>It cannot be mounted as a drive.</li>
			<li>Accessed using http/https.</li>
			--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			<br><b>Expectations from cloud storage:</b>

			<br><b>Scalability:</b> The storage system should support the scalability of the user’s data.
			<br><b>High availability:</b>The degree of availability of the storage solutions deployed in the cloud should be very high.
			<br><b>High bandwidth:</b> The cloud storage system should support the required fast data transfer rate.
			<br><b>Constant performance:</b> There should not be any performance issues associated with the cloud storage system, and the performance should be consistent throughout the contract period.
			<br><b>Load balancing (LB):</b> In order to achieve effective resource usage, the storage systems deployed in the cloud should be intelligent enough to support the automatic LB of the users’ data.

			<h2>Types of Cloud Storage</h2>
			<h3>There are four types of Cloud-Storage as detailed below:</h3>

			<li>Personal cloud storage</li>
			<li>Public cloud Storage</li>
			<li>Private cloud Storage</li>
			<li>Hybrid cloud Storage</li>

			<h3>Advantages of Cloud Storage</h3>
			<b>The advantages of Cloud Storage include:</b>

			<br><b>1. File Accessibility –</b> The files can be accessed at any time from any place so long as you have Internet access.
			<br><b>2. Offsite Backup – </b>Cloud Storage provides organizations with offsite (remote) backups of data which in turn reduces costs.
			<br><b>3. Effective Use of Bandwidth –</b> Cloud storage uses the bandwidth effectively i.e. instead of sending files to recipients, a web link can be sent through email.
			<br><b>4. Security of Data –</b> Helps in protecting the data against ransomware or malware as it is secured and needs proper authentication to access the stored data.
				
			<h3>Disadvantages of Cloud Storage</h3>
			<b>The disadvantages of Cloud Storage include:</b>

			<br><b>1. Dependency on Internet Speed –</b> If the Internet connection is slow or unstable, we might have problems accessing or sharing the files.
			<br><b>2. Dependency on a Third Party –</b> A third-party service provider (company) is responsible for the data stored and hence it becomes an important pre-requisite in selecting a vendor and examining the security standards prior to investing.
			<br><b>3. High Cost for Huge Data –</b> Organizations that require a large amount of storage may also find costs increase significantly even after the first few gigabytes of data stored.
			<br><b>4. No,Minimal Control over Data Storage Framework –</b> Since the cloud storage framework is entirely managed and monitored by the service provider, the customer has minimal control over it.
				
			<h2>Networking Support for Cloud Computing</h2>

			<br>Cloud networking is a type of IT infrastructure in which some or all of an organization’s network capabilities and resources are hosted in a public or private cloud platform, managed in-house or by a service provider, and available on demand.
			<br>Companies can either use on-premises cloud networking resources to build a private cloud network or use cloud-based networking resources in the public cloud or a hybrid cloud combination of both.
			<br>These network resources can include virtual routers, firewalls, and bandwidth and network management software, with other tools and functions available as required. 

			<br>There are three principal areas in which the network architecture is of importance to cloud computing:
			<li>data center network that interconnects the infrastructure resources (e.g. servers and storage devices) within a cloud service data center.</li>
			<li>data center interconnect network that connects multiple data centers in a private, public, or hybrid cloud to supporting the cloud services.</li>
			<li>the public Internet that connects end-users to the public cloud provider’s data centers.</li>

			<br><b>The top cloud network performance metric to consider are:</b>

			<li><b>Network latency:</b> Network delays slow operations and affects progress. These delays can either be one-way or involving different communication paths. There are three components involved in network latency: round trip time (RTT), server processing latency, and server throughput. By optimizing latency, network teams ensure better network speeds and reduced congestions.
			<li><b>Bandwidth management:</b> Network traffic control is a fundamental part of cloud network optimization. This involves bandwidth management, where queuing in routers is minimized, non-essential applications are controlled, and traffic and applications are prioritized to ensure the necessary bandwidth is available to the right users.
			<li><b>Network traffic management:</b> The performance and security of existing networks is closely tied to their bandwidth, traffic patterns, and proactive network diagnostics. With network management tools, you can identify which applications are hampering bandwidth, how traffic patterns are evolving, and control rate limiting configurations.

			<br><b>Series of strategies to mitigate security breaches, such as:</b>

			<li>Having policies in place that clearly define cloud ownership</li>
			<li>A roadmap that accompanies the entire lifecycle of cloud governance</li>
			<li>Defining a cloud management platform that connects both cloud-based applications and onsite</li>
			<li>infrastructure for better tracking, visibility, and problem control</li>
			<li>Implementing data encryption</li>
			<li>Enabling two-factor authentication</li>
			<li>Conducting data backups</li>
			<li>Conducting due diligence about cloud service providers</li>


			<br><b>Benefits of cloud networking</b>
				As the cloud evolved, so did the benefits it offered through different resources. Some of these benefits include:

			<li>Lower cost: Without the need to buy and maintain expensive servers and hardware resources, companies save on capital costs. This gives technical departments better flexibility with budgets and allows upgrades for network performance optimization that wouldn’t otherwise be possible.</li>
			<li>Minimum downtime: The cloud provider handles all the updates related to the cloud resources it offers. This means one less operational issue for network teams to consider. In most instances, if there’s downtime, it’s communicated in advance, allowing time for alternative solutions to be put in place.</li>
			<li>Scalability: With cloud networking, IT teams can assess business needs and modify capacity as the needs arise. This is usually a seamless process in the cloud but would usually lead to disruptions in the case of traditional networks.</li>
			<li>Productivity: With a service provider leading the maintenance, automatic update, and testing of cloud networks, you’ll find the time spent on administrative tasks is cut considerably. As a result, you can focus on other technical requirements.</li>
			<li>Resilience and elasticity: Uptime and consistent performance have to be factored in when planning the future of a computer network. Cloud networking has proven to be resilient (when planned for) and ensures continuity with the right provider.</li>
