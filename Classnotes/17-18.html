			<h2> Cloud Computing & Big Data </h2>
			
Cloud computing is the provision of computing services, such as servers, storage, databases, networks, software, analysis, intelligence, and more, over the Internet to deliver faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.


<br><br><h3>Cloud Programming</h3>
• Basically, there is not anyone specific language for cloud computing. It depends on what type of product we want to work on.
<br>• To create a web app we need Html, CSS, a backend language for our server, and Javascript
<br>• There are alternatives to Javascript, but not all browsers support all of them or these languages are translated into Javascript so that at least understanding java script is be important.
<br>• There are a lot of backend languages available, choose one matching to the task.
<br>• If you want to be fast in developing and there is no complex computation involved, Ruby or Python might be a good start.
<br>• If speed matters as well as parallelization, so we might have high traffic on our servers, other languages like Elixir, Scala, Golang, or Clojure might be better candidates.

<br><b>Roles in Cloud Computing domain:</b>
<br>• Cloud Engineer
<br>• Cloud Architect
<br>• Cloud Developer
<br>• Cloud Administrator
<br>• Cloud Practitioner
<br>• Cloud Data Engineer
<br>• Cloud Machine Learning Specialist
<br>• Cloud Networking Specialist
<br>• Cloud Security Engineer
<br>• Cloud Support Engineer

<br> A programming language defines a set of instructions that are compiled together to perform a specific task by the CPU (Central Processing Unit).
<br>• Each programming language contains a unique set of keywords and syntax, which are used to create a set of instructions.
<br>• Thousands of programming languages have been developed till now, but each language has its specific purpose.
<br>• These languages vary in the level of abstraction they provide from the hardware.
<br>• Some programming languages provide less or no abstraction while some provide higher abstraction. Based on the levels of abstraction, they can be classified into two categories:
<br>• Low-level language
<br>• The low-level language is a programming language that provides no abstraction from the hardware, and it is represented in 0 or 1 forms, which are the machine instructions. The languages that come under this category are the Machine level language and Assembly language.
<br>• High-level language
<br>• The high-level language is a programming language that allows a programmer to write programs that are independent of a particular type of computer.
<br>• High-level languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages than machine-level languages.
<br>• When writing a program in a high-level language, then the whole attention needs to be paid to the logic of the problem.
<br>• A compiler is required to translate a high-level language into a low-level language.
<br><b>Advantages of a high-level language</b>
<br>• The high-level language is easy to read, write, and maintain as it is written in English-like words.
<br>• The high-level languages are designed to overcome the limitation of low-level language, i.e., portability. The high-level language is portable; i.e., these languages are machine-independent.

<br><br><h3>Java</h3>
• Java is again a popular programming language when it comes to cloud development. It is easy to learn, robust, versatile, and modular which makes it easier to write codes by considering its reusability feature.
<br>• It is widely known as a general-purpose programming language.
<br>• Today, it has positioned itself as one of the best programming languages for cloud computing and is used by millions of developers and executed in over 15 billion terminals across the globe.
<br>• It is a platform-independent language because the code is first compiled into byte code which does not depend on any platform.
<br>• It is used by a vast number of enterprise cloud applications as it is secure, scalable, and portable.
<br>• Almost all major cloud platforms provide SDKs for Java which in turn highly simplifies the development and enhances capabilities.
<br>• If you choose to go for AWS training and Certification, Java is said to be the best choice as a programming language.
<br>• Cloud apps built with Java can run on different operating systems including Linux, Windows, Raspberry, etc.

<br><br><h3>Python</h3>
• Python definitely tops the list for the best programming language to learn for cloud computing and cloud development.
<br>• It comes packed with hundreds of third-party modules and support libraries to make the development process easier, more secure, and swift.
<br>• It is worthwhile to note that Python is considerably used in the development of serverless applications on Amazon Web Services and is also supported by AWS Lambda.
<br>• While having cross-platform support, Python is also known as a full-stack programming language, meaning that it can be used in all the parts of the cloud development lifecycle.
<br>• Not just AWS has a high dependency on Python, but even Microsoft’s Azure Cloud supports Python for cloud development.
<br>• With huge community support and being extensively used in the cloud, data-related technologies, and software development, Python is not going to die down in the near future and will only be replacing a lot more languages. So if you are planning to be a cloud engineer, Python is the best fit for you!

<br>Serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by AWS.

<br><br><h3>Golang</h3>
• Golang might not be the programming language you hear about every day, but it is undoubtedly one of the best in the cloud computing sphere.
<br>• It is a simple and fast language commonly used for server development.
<br>• Due to its highly advanced tools for concurrency and parallelism management and its robust framework, it is actively used to develop applications for IoT development, drones, and robots.

<br><br><h3>Ruby</h3>
• Ruby is an ideal choice for cloud developers not only because it is easy to learn and has features like security and high functionality, but also has a multitude of learning resources for creating modern applications.
<br>• It contains more than 60,000 libraries and frameworks that assist you in every way possible to develop an app with minimal difficulty.
<br>• It is open-sourced with active community support.
<br>• Applications developed in Ruby on Google cloud can easily be integrated with Cloud monitoring, trace, error reporting, and logging.
<br>• Ruby is highly dynamic and therefore tuned for web-based applications.
<br>• To deploy Ruby applications on the cloud, you have to write a lot less code when compared to Java and C#.
<br>• Ruby has gained a lot of interest in developing cloud-based applications and you should certainly try it.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>Parallel and distributed programming paradigms</h2>
<h3>Serial and Parallel Processes</h3>
<br>A serial process is simply a process that is run entirely by one core of one processor. This means tasks are run one after another as they appear in code. This is analogous to you doing the jigsaw puzzle on your own.

<br>A parallel process is a process that is divided among multiple cores in a processor or set of processors. Each sub-process can have its own set of memory as well as share memory with other processes. This is analogous to doing the puzzle with the help of friends. Because a supercomputer has a large network of nodes with many cores, we must implement parallelization strategies with our applications to fully utilize a supercomputing resource.

<h3>Parallel programming: </h3>
<br>It is the use of multiple processing elements (processors) simultaneously for solving any problem.
<br>• Problems are broken down into instructions and are solved concurrently as each resource that has been applied to work is working at the same time. 
<br>• Parallel computing is a type of computing architecture in which several processors simultaneously execute multiple, smaller calculations broken down from an overall larger, complex problem via shared memory.
<br>• This type of programming takes a problem, breaks it down into a series of smaller steps, delivers instructions, and processors execute the solutions at the same time.
<br>• It is also a form of programming that offers the same results as concurrent programming but in less time and with more efficiency.
<br>• Many computers, such as laptops and personal desktops, use this programming in their hardware to ensure that tasks are quickly completed in the background.

<br><br><b>Advantages of Parallel Computing over Serial Computing are as follows: </b>

<br>• It saves time and money as many resources working together will reduce the time and cut potential costs. 
<br>• It can be impractical to solve larger problems on Serial Computing. 
<br>• It can take advantage of non-local resources when the local resources are finite. 
<br>• Serial Computing ‘wastes’ the potential computing power, thus Parallel Computing makes better work of the hardware. 

<br><br><b>Disadvantages</b>
<br>• It can be difficult to learn; programming that targets parallel architectures.
<br>• Additionally, code tweaking is not straightforward and must be modified for different target architectures to properly improve performance.
<br>• It’s also hard to estimate consistent results because communication of results can be problematic for certain architectures.
<br>• Finally, power consumption is a problem for those instituting a multitude of processors for various architectures; a variety of cooling technologies will be required in order to cool the parallel clusters.

<br><br><b>Difference Between Parallel Computing and Cloud Computing</b>
<br>• Cloud computing is a general term that refers to the delivery of scalable services, such as databases, data storage, networking, servers, and software, over the Internet on an as-needed, pay-as-you-go basis.

<br>• Cloud computing services can be public or private, are fully managed by the provider, and facilitate remote access to data, work, and applications from any device in any place capable of establishing an Internet connection. The three most common service categories are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

<br>• Cloud computing is a relatively new paradigm in software development that facilitates broader access to parallel computing via vast, virtual computer clusters, allowing the average user and smaller organizations to leverage parallel processing power and storage options typically reserved for large enterprises.


<br><br><b>How to achieve a parallel computation is divided roughly into two paradigms.</b>

<li>One is “data-parallel” and the other is “message passing”.</li>
<li>“OpenMP” is based on “data parallelism”.</li>
<li>MPI (Message Passing Interface) belongs to the second paradigm.</li>

<br><b>Message passing vs data parallelism</b>
<li>In the message-passing paradigm, each CPU (or core) runs an independent program.</li>
<li>Parallelism is achieved by receiving data which it doesn’t have and sending data that it has.</li>
<li>In the data parallel paradigm, there are many different data and the same operations (instructions in assembly language) are performed on these data at the same time.</li>
<li>Parallelism is achieved by how many different data a single operation can act on.</li>

<br><br><b>Distributed programming</b>
<li>A distributed computer system consists of multiple software components that are on multiple computers but run as a single system.</li>
<li>The computers that are in a distributed system can be physically close together and connected by a local network, or they can be geographically distant and connected by a wide area network.</li>
<li>A distributed system can consist of any number of possible configurations, such as mainframes, personal computers, workstations, minicomputers, and so on. The goal of distributed computing is to make such a network work as a single computer.</li>
<li>Data or Information in distributed.</li>

<br>Distributed computing is therefore based on agreed-upon protocols generally being followed, but they may not be in any given instance. E.g., the server of some web content may tell you to fetch some advertising images and your computer may be instructed to ignore those requests.

<br><b>Examples for Distributed Computing:</b>

<br>• Internet
<br>• Internet of Things (IoT)
<br>• Grid Computing
<br>So, distributing computing uses multiple computers in the network to coordinate and complete tasks. It makes users realize that they use just a single computer but in the background his/her operation might have hit multiple computers in a distributed system.

<br><b>Distributed systems offer many benefits over centralized systems, including the following:</b>
<br><b>Scalability</b>
<br>The system can easily be expanded by adding more machines as needed.
<br><b>Redundancy</b>
<br>Several machines can provide the same services, so if one is unavailable, work does not stop. Additionally, because many smaller machines can be used, this redundancy does not need to be prohibitively expensive.
