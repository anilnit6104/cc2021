			<h3> Internet of Things</h3>
			
			<li>The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to the billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet, all collecting and sharing data. </li>
			<li>Due to the arrival of super-cheap computer chips and the ubiquity of wireless networks, it's possible to turn anything, from something as small as a pill to something as big as an airplane. </li>
			<li>Connecting up all these different objects and adding sensors to them adds a level of digital intelligence to devices that would be otherwise dumb, enabling them to communicate real-time data without involving a human being. </li>
			<li>The Internet of Things is making the fabric of the world around us smarter and more responsive, merging the digital and physical universes. </li>

			<br><h3><b>Examples of IOT devices:</b></h3>
            <li> Smart Mobiles, smart refrigerators, smart watches, smart fire alarm, smart door lock, smart bicycle, medical sensors, fitness trackers, smart security system etc., are few examples of IoT products. </li>

			<br><br><h3>How does IoT work and what does makes them smart device? </h3>
			<br>It basically depends on two things to transform a normal device into IoT smart device.

			<br>They are:

			<li>The device which has the capability to connect with the internet in any way. </li>
			<li>The device which is integrated with technology like sensors, functional software, some inbuilt technology that support network connections.</li>

			<br> Please refer to the below graph to know the increasing demand for these devices in the near future:

			<h3>ROLE OF CLOUD IN INTERNET OF THINGS (IoT)</h3>

			<li>Scalability</li>
			<li>Data Mobility</li>
			<li>Security</li>
			<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>

			<h3>Characteristics of IoT </h3>
			<li>Unique identity</li>
			<li>Dynamic nature ( number of devices, change in environment)</li>
			<li>Self-adapting ( adaptation to environment change) eg surveillance camera</li>

			<li> <b>Heterogeneity ( different types of devices, network) : </b>
				Internet of things is capable of connecting billions of smart devices via various communication technologies such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. ... Leveraging heterogeneity has become challenging because of emerging diverse IoT devices in the market.
            </li>
			
			<li>Integrated to information network e.g., Weather prediction (data analysis)</li>
			<li>Self-configuring ( network, latest update)</li>

			<br><h3>Benefits of IoT</h3>
			<li>Efficient resource utilization  ( e.g., at the time of locking home switch of the lights) </li>
			<li>Improved productivity of staff and reduced human labor
				Thanks to IoT solutions, mundane tasks can be done automatically, so human resources may be transferred to more complex tasks that require personal skills, especially out-of-the-box thinking. This way, the number of workers can be minimized, which results in reduced costs of business operation.</li>

			<li>Saves time e.g. (wireless sensors can detect when you walk into a Starbucks, which alerts the barista of your likely order based on your order history.  You can then confirm or choose a different order, then pay for it using your phone). </li>
			<li>Human efforts & errors</li>
			<li>Security</li>
			<li>User-friendly/ Ease to use (language )</li>
			<li>Improved customer service and retention</li>
			<li>Thorough marketing and business development</li>
			<li>Smart devices that are situated at homes, especially voice assistants and other appliances that can directly communicate with end-users on a regular basis, provide invaluable source information for business analysis. IoT helps enterprises by gathering large volumes of user-specific data employed for developing business strategies, targeted advertising, fine-tuning price policy, and other marketing and management activities.</li>


			<br><h3>IoT Security Problem</h3>

			<li>Denial of service</li>
			<li>Distributed denial of services.</li>
			<li>Unauthorized Access (credentials miss-use)</li>
			<li>Information manipulation</li>
			<li>Information disclosure  (location of servers)</li>
			<li>Lack Of User Knowledge & Awareness</li>

			<br><h3>Cloud Computing Architecture</h3>
            <br>Cloud computing architecture is a combination of service-oriented architecture and event-driven architecture.
			
			<br><br><b>What is an Event?</b>
		    <li>An event is defined as a change of state of some key business system.</li>
			<li>For instance, somebody buys a product, someone else checks in for a flight or a bus is late arriving somewhere.</li>
			<li>And if one thinks about it, events exist everywhere and are constantly happening, no matter what industry.</li>
			<li>They are pervasive across any business.</li>
			<li>This includes anything that creates a message by being produced, published, detected, or consumed is considered an event.</li>
		    <br>In an event-driven architecture, an event will likely trigger one or more actions or processes in response to its occurrence. An example of an event might include:</li>
            <li>Request to reset a password</li>
			<li>A package arrived was delivered to its destination</li>
			<li>A grocery warehouse updates its inventory</li>
			<li>An unauthorized access attempt was denied</li>
			<br>Each of these events is likely to trigger one or more actions or processes in response. One response might be simply to log the event for monitoring purposes. Others might be:

			<li>An email to reset the password is sent to the customer</li>
			<li>The sales ticket is closed</li>
			<li>An order for more lettuce (or whatever materials are running low) is placed</li>
			<li>An account is locked and security personnel are notified</li>
					
			<br><b>Service -1  ----  Event ----> Service2</b>
			<br>Command
					<br>S1 <------> S2  (  expecting a response)
					<br>Components
					<br>> Producer
					<br>> Broker
					<br>> Consumer
			
			<br><br><b>Advantages</b>
					<br>> Decoupling
					<br>> Invert Dependencies
					<br>> Scalability
					
			<br><br><em>S1 -----> S2 ( coupling )
					<br>S1 --> E1----> S2
					<br><p>				  -----S3</p>
					Events Persistence
					<br>S1 ---> Broker -----> S2
					<br><p>				------> S3</p> </em>
					<br>>Broker can save the event info for later stage
					<br>>More robust, scalable
					<br>>Eventual Consistency
			<br><br><h2>Event-driven Architecture</h2>
					<li>Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern that enables an organization to detect “events” or important business moments (such as a transaction, site visit, shopping cart abandonment, etc) and act on them in real-time or near real-time.</li>
					<li>This pattern replaces the traditional “request/response” architecture where services would have to wait for a reply before they could move onto the next task.</li>
					<li>The flow of event-driven architecture is run by events and it is designed to respond to them or carry out some action in response to an event.</li>
			<br>Examples of events include the taking of measurements, the pressing of a button, or the swiping of a credit card.

			<br><br><h2>Service-Oriented Architecture</h2>
			<br>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural approach in which applications make use of services available in the network. In this architecture, services are provided to form applications, through a communication call over the internet. 
			<li>SOA allows users to combine a large number of facilities from existing services to form applications.</li>
			<li>SOA encompasses a set of design principles that structure system development and provide means for integrating components into a coherent and decentralized system.</li>
			<li>SOA-based computing packages functionalities into a set of interoperable services, which can be integrated into different software systems belonging to separate business domains.</li>

			<br>Cloud computing architecture is divided into the following two parts -
					<li>Front End</li>
					<li>Back End</li>

			<br><h4>Front End</h4>
					<p>The front end is used by the client. It contains client-side interfaces and applications that are required to access the cloud computing platforms. The front end includes web servers (including Chrome, Firefox, internet explorer, etc.), thin & fat clients, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>
			
			<br><h4>Back End</h4>
					<p>The back end is used by the service provider. It manages all the resources that are required to provide cloud computing services. It includes a huge amount of data storage, security mechanism, virtual machines, deploying models, servers, traffic control mechanisms, etc.</p>
