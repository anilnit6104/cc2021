				The cloud computing reference model is an abstract model that characterizes and standardizes the functions of a cloud computing environment by partitioning it into abstraction layers and cross-layer functions.
				This reference model groups the cloud computing functions and activities into five logical layers and three cross-layer functions.
            <br><img src="images/26.png">
			
			<br>The physical layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided and typically includes server, storage, and network components. 
			<br><b>Virtual Layer</b>

			<li>Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware.</li>
			<li>Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer system simultaneously.</li>
			<li>To the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits below it.</li>

			<li>Deployed on the physical layer.</li>
			<li>Specifies entities that operate at this layer: Virtualization software, resource pools, virtual resources.</li>
			<li>Functions of virtual layer: Abstracts physical resources and makes them appear as virtual resources (enables multitenant environment). Executes the requests generated by the control layer.</li>

			<br><h3>Difference between cloud and virtualisation?</h3>
					It’s easy to confuse virtualization and cloud, particularly because they both revolve around creating useful environments from abstract resources. However, virtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from a single, physical hardware system, and clouds are IT environments that abstract, pool, and share scalable resources across a network. To put it simply, virtualization is a technology, where cloud is an environment.

			<br><b>Control layer:</b> Enables resource configuration, resource pool configuration and resource provisioning. Executes requests generated by the service layer. Exposes resources to and supports the service layer. Collaborates with the virtualization software and enables resource pooling and creating virtual resources, dynamic allocation and optimizing utilization of resources.

			<br><h3>Service Orchestration Layer</h3>
					<li>Functions of orchestration layer: Provides workflows for executing automated tasks. Interacts with various entities to invoke provisioning tasks.</li>

			<br><h3>Service Layer</h3>
			<li>Consumers interact and consume cloud resources via this layer.</li>
			<li>Functions of service layer: Store information about cloud services in the service catalog and presents them to the consumers. Enables consumers to access and manage cloud services via a self-service portal.</li>
					
			<br><h3>Cross-layer function</h3>
			<br><h4>Business continuity</h4>
			<li>Specifies adoption of proactive and reactive measures to mitigate the impact of downtime.</li>
			<li>Enables ensuring the availability of services in line with SLA.</li>
			<li>Supports all the layers to provide uninterrupted services.</li>

			<br><h4>Security</h4>
			<li>Specifies the adoption of Administrative mechanisms (security and personnel policies, standard procedures to direct safe execution of operations) and technical mechanisms (firewall, intrusion detection, and prevention systems, antivirus).</li>
			<li>Deploys security mechanisms to meet Governance, risk and compliance (GRC) requirements.</li>
			<li>Supports all the layers to provide secure services.</li>

			<br><h4>Service Management</h4>
			<p><br>Specifies adoption of activities related to service portfolio management and service operation management.

			<br><br><b>Service portfolio management :</b>
			<br>• Define the service roadmap, service features, and service levels
			<br>• Assess and prioritize where investments across the service portfolio are most needed
			<br>• Establish budgeting and pricing.
			<br>• Deal with consumers in supporting activities such as taking orders, processing bills, and collecting payments.


			<br><br><b>Service operation management :</b>
			<br>• Enables infrastructure configuration and resource provisioning
			<br>• Enable problem resolution.
			<br>• Enables capacity and availability management.
			<br>• Enables compliance conformance.
			<br>• Enables monitoring cloud services and their constituent elements.</P>
